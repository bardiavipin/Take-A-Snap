# Take-A-Snap
Take a Snap is a plugin which allows you to use your camera when you are  browsing account settings from  html5 supported browser.

You can use front\rear camera to click selfie or picture.
Click the picture and select OK.
Crop it if you want.

If your camera resolution is very high, then it may take time to upload\display image.
Image size would be the reason if you can see the message saying like "Oops" while upload

Please change upload settings before you start!
For best results, use horizontal mode.

Tested mobile browser:
Chrome, Version : 61+
Safari, Version : 11.0.3

This functionality is part of liferay-ui:logo-selector, so whenever you use the tag, you will get the same result.

Depending on the feedback, I will add webcam support in the similar manner.
